Honored to be deliver the valedictorian speech at the KAIST Commencement 2025 as the representative graduate of the class of 2025!ðŸŽ“ðŸŽ“

On top of my incredibly dazzling memories, respectful advisors, and invaluable colleagues, I was honored to share my memories through my valedictorian speech at the KAIST Commencement 2025. Through my collegiate years at KAIST, I savored the delights of publishing journal papers, presenting at conferences, applying for patents, writing books, directing and organizing outreach programs, surmounting discouragements, failures, and dejections.

During our years at KAIST, we have glimpsed how a part of my experiences becomes yours and vice versa. My heartiest thanks to all those who have constituted a part of my collegiate years! Perhaps we were somehow meant to meet since when I started to dream toward KAIST.ðŸ¥°
