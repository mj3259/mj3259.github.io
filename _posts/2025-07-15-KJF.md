Honorably selected as a recipient of the Kwanjeong Doctoral Study Abroad Fellowship and Ilju Doctoral Study Abroad Fellowship, the two most prestigious scholarships for study abroad students in Korea.
These are merit-based and highly competitive scholarships with an acceptance ratio under 2% in general.
I chose the Kwanjeong Fellowship for my doctoral studies at Stanford.
