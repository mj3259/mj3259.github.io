Awarded the National Presidential Science Scholarship, patronized by the President. The scholarship is the highest honor at the collegiate level, with only about 130 students selected nationwide annually. Recipients are supported by their full tuition and stipends(2,500,000 KRW/semester) for 4 years.

My research project on conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS was highlighted in the "Young Science Talk", and displayed in the Gwacheon National Science Museum as a representative work done by the scholarship recipients.
