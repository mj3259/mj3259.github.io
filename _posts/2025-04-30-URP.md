Selected as one of three recipients of the Grand Prix amongst 60 individuals/teams at the Undergraduate Research Program (URP) workshop.

My work on carbon dioxide sensor (see [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.device.2024.100681](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.device.2024.100681).) supported by the KAIST URP Grant has been highlighted by many news media and appeared on the KAIST Youtube!

Moreover, I presented my work at the 2025 KAIST Research Day as the representative undergraduate researcher!
