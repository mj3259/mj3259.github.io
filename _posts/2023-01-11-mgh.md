It is my great honor to be selected as one of six KAIST delegates participating in “Harvard-MIT Summer Institute at MGH”! During the aspired opportunity, I am going to visit Harvard medical school and Massachusetts General Hospital this summer and pursue research on biomedical optics and photo-therapeutics.
